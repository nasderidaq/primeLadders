# Prime Ladders

Program to solve for the 2022-5-6 Riddler Classic found at [Can You Build The Longest Ladder?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-build-the-longest-ladder/).

Runnable playground [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nasderidaq/primeLadders/blob/master/src/primeLadders.html) (use the console and the `window.getLongestLadder` exports).

## Problem

For the complete set of n-digit primes, find the longest possible optimal path (the graph's "diameter") between two of the primes while only changing 1 digit at a time.

e.g. For 2-digit primes, the maximum optimal path length is 4. One such path is `53 -> 13 -> 17 -> 97`.

## Strategy
